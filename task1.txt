### **Summary**

A seasoned Cybersecurity Architect and Threat Intelligence Leader with over 23 years of experience architecting resilient defenses and delivering actionable intelligence for global enterprises and financial institutions. My expertise lies in transforming complex cyber risks into strategic advantages by integrating an "attacker's mindset"—validated by top-tier HackerOne rankings—with robust security architecture and executive-level threat reporting. I specialize in monitoring the Dark Web, leading proactive threat hunting on critical infrastructure, and bridging the gap between deep technical risk and C-suite understanding.
